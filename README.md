## Description:

The calculator enables individuals to investigate different situations such as interest rate rises, changes in rent and how these will affect the profitability of their investment house, as well as enabling new investors to find a good positive gearing property.

Based on the label of the slider, users can appropriately choose a value affecting their property. Users can also toggle the advanced input to display more sliders for more detailed property values. Users can tick the view breakdown checkbox to display a pie chart showing all expenses. After filling out the bars and fields with values, the left will display the calculation results, including both expenses and profit. 

If comparison is needed for multiple property evaluations, you can save each calculation with the snapshot function with a descriptive name.

## How to run:

This calculator is avaliable online (link above). 

A local version can also be run by downloading the files in this github, installing all required python modules using **'pip install -r requirements.txt'**, then navigate to the directory of the code and type **'streamlit run main.py'** to start the application. A local version will be avaliable through the web browser.
